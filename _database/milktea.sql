As a unique combination of music and song, Then singing is traditionally accompanied by a handmade gourd lute, called Dan Tinh or Tinh Tau. The form of art plays an important role in the spiritual life of Tay, Nung and Thai ethnic people as it combines a wide range of arts such as literature, music, painting and performance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The art form has had an impact on local and national identities through its influence on literature, language, poetry, music, dance, rituals and spiritual practices. Closely linked with the spiritual life of ethnic minority groups who often use ceremonial offerings to treat illnesses, Then singing is seen as a therapy, together with medicine, helping to ease the worries of patients and their families</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-340 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frame-1056-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1499\" height=\"730\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Presently, Tay people often organize singing ceremonies with the aim to drive away bad luck, pray for good crops and call back the souls of the dead. The music encourages ethnic people who gather around the fire every night after a hard working day in the fields to sing together traditional Then songs. It is really a beautiful image to see Tay girls and boys in traditional clothes singing with high and clear voices amid the imposing scene of mountains and forests. At a time when Then singing artists are getting older and not many young people show their love for the tradition, it is necessary to diversify methods to preserve the singing. Apart from collection and restoration of traditional Then songs, relevant agencies should pay special attention to Then singing artists, who can impart both Then singing skills and their passion for the art to younger generations.</p>\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZvEGsVQXEs\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would suggest the establishment of Then singing clubs and including the art form to the school curriculum. It should be further promoted on mass media, helping young people understand about the nation’s art heritage and raise their responsibility for preserving and developing it.

For me, it\'s an exquisite elixir that soothes moments of tension and brings solace to my soul.

Heartbreaking incidents resulted from individuals operating vehicles with high levels of alcohol in their system, exceeding legal limits. My journey began in 7th grade, embarking on my first AI programming project, which was applied to the self-driving car project designed by GotIt\'s Founder and Chief Architect, Gabi Zuniga. During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to learn from the experts at Got It Inc. The future expanded before me as I designed an AI-based delivery robot that autonomously followed pre-programmed routes. The concept of driverless cars was relatively new in Vietnam, and the revelation that a robot could operate independently using AI technology surprised many. My story of creating a self-driving car as an 7th-grade student opened doors to meeting numerous experts in Vietnam\'s technology industry. I hope it serves as motivation for young tech enthusiasts, demonstrating that it\'s never early or late to pursue their dreams.</p>'),

Over the course of my internship, I had the privilege of delving into the world of Artificial Intelligence, where I honed my skills, deepened my knowledge, and played a pivotal role in the organization\'s ongoing success.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhancing Python Programming Skills</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the central pillars of my internship was the significant improvement in my Python programming skills. As a fundamental language for AI development, Python is the linchpin of numerous AI projects. During my tenure at Got It, Inc., I had the opportunity to write code that was both functional and efficient. This journey involved mastering Python libraries, frameworks, and, most importantly, the best practices for Python development. The experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, furthering my understanding of the language\'s intricacies.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Art of Problem-Solving and Organization</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI development is often akin to solving intricate puzzles, and my internship honed my problem-solving abilities. The projects I worked on presented multifaceted challenges that required creative and analytical thinking. These experiences not only tested my skills but also broadened my problem-solving repertoire. I learned to analyze data, develop algorithms, and troubleshoot issues as they arose, a skill set that extends far beyond AI into everyday problem-solving.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another vital aspect of my internship was organization. In the fast-paced world of AI development, maintaining order and structure is essential. I was responsible for managing data, code, and project-related documents. Effective organization streamlined the development process, making it more efficient and enabling our team to work seamlessly.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastering Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world of AI is intrinsically tied to powerful tools, and my internship introduced me to two invaluable ones - Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. Jupyter Notebook became my trusted companion for interactive data analysis and reporting. Its versatility allowed me to explore data and present findings in an engaging and informative manner. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, became my go-to platform for code development, debugging, and version control. These tools not only facilitated my work but also accelerated my learning curve, allowing me to be more productive and collaborative.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testing and Suggesting Improvements</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an AI intern, I had the responsibility of rigorously testing applications and AI products. This task was a crucial step in ensuring the quality and performance of the projects we were working on. I was not just identifying issues and bugs but also actively contributing by suggesting improvements.

As a fundamental language for AI development, Python is the linchpin of numerous AI projects. During my tenure at Got It, Inc., I had the opportunity to write code that was both functional and efficient. This journey involved mastering Python libraries, frameworks, and, most importantly, the best practices for Python development. The experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, furthering my understanding of the language\'s intricacies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Art of Problem-Solving and Organization\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAI development is often akin to solving intricate puzzles, and my internship honed my problem-solving abilities. The projects I worked on presented multifaceted challenges that required creative and analytical thinking. These experiences not only tested my skills but also broadened my problem-solving repertoire. I learned to analyze data, develop algorithms, and troubleshoot issues as they arose, a skill set that extends far beyond AI into everyday problem-solving.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother vital aspect of my internship was organization. In the fast-paced world of AI development, maintaining order and structure is essential. I was responsible for managing data, code, and project-related documents.

Jupyter Notebook became my trusted companion for interactive data analysis and reporting. Its versatility allowed me to explore data and present findings in an engaging and informative manner. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, became my go-to platform for code development, debugging, and version control.

Having previously worked for IBM Watson, he decided to join Got It approximately three years ago and frequently commutes between the United States and Vietnam to work with Got It\'s team in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn a recent visit, he was pleasantly surprised to find a young boy walking around the Got It Vietnam office. He was curious and had many questions!\r\n\r\nThe young boy was Tuấn Anh, who is only 13 years old. Last year, he became the youngest software engineering intern at Got It. On his first day, he had just graduated from the 6th grade. In a little over three months, Tuấn Anh completed an impressive university-level course and even worked on a self-driving car project.\r\n\r\n\"My mom knew I was interested in programming and started looking for anything related to it that I could do online. She stumbled upon Got It. My mom asked her friends how Got It worked and managed to arrange an interview for me, which led to my internship here,\" Tuấn Anh shared with Gabi Zuniga. Before joining Got It, Tuấn Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. He emphasized that his goal was to build a solid foundation for the future rather than winning competitions or impressing his mother.\r\n\r\n\"This kid is truly amazing!\" Gabi Zuniga exclaimed in surprise as he listened to Tuấn Anh\'s story of learning and creating a software-based self-driving car with guidance from Got It\'s engineers.'),

(1653, 190, 'list_1_content', 'Embarking on an internship journey at Got It, Inc. as an AI intern was not just a stepping stone in my career; it was a profound learning experience that left a lasting impact on my professional growth. Over the course of my internship, I had the privilege of delving into the world of Artificial Intelligence, where I honed my skills, deepened my knowledge, and played a pivotal role in the organization\'s ongoing success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Enhancing Python Programming Skills</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the central pillars of my internship was the significant improvement in my Python programming skills. As a fundamental language for AI development, Python is the linchpin of numerous AI projects. During my tenure at Got It, Inc., I had the opportunity to write code that was both functional and efficient. This journey involved mastering Python libraries, frameworks, and, most importantly, the best practices for Python development. The experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, furthering my understanding of the language\'s intricacies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>The Art of Problem-Solving and Organization</strong>\r\n\r\nAI development is often akin to solving intricate puzzles, and my internship honed my problem-solving abilities. The projects I worked on presented multifaceted challenges that required creative and analytical thinking. These experiences not only tested my skills but also broadened my problem-solving repertoire. I learned to analyze data, develop algorithms, and troubleshoot issues as they arose, a skill set that extends far beyond AI into everyday problem-solving.\r\n\r\nAnother vital aspect of my internship was organization. In the fast-paced world of AI development, maintaining order and structure is essential. I was responsible for managing data, code, and project-related documents. Effective organization streamlined the development process, making it more efficient and enabling our team to work seamlessly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Mastering Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code</strong>\r\n\r\nThe world of AI is intrinsically tied to powerful tools, and my internship introduced me to two invaluable ones - Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. Jupyter Notebook became my trusted companion for interactive data analysis and reporting. Its versatility allowed me to explore data and present findings in an engaging and informative manner. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, became my go-to platform for code development, debugging, and version control. These tools not only facilitated my work but also accelerated my learning curve, allowing me to be more productive and collaborative.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Testing and Suggesting Improvements</strong>\r\n\r\nAs an AI intern, I had the responsibility of rigorously testing applications and AI products. This task was a crucial step in ensuring the quality and performance of the projects we were working on. I was not just identifying issues and bugs but also actively contributing by suggesting improvements. This hands-on experience enabled me to understand the importance of quality assurance in AI and the iterative nature of development.\r\n\r\nMy internship at Got It, Inc. was a transformative journey that allowed me to evolve as an AI professional. It was a unique blend of learning and contribution, where I not only improved my Python programming skills, honed my problem-solving abilities, and mastered essential AI tools but also actively participated in the development and enhancement of AI applications. This experience has left an indelible mark on my career and has ignited a continued passion for the limitless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained during this internship in my future endeavors.'),

(1741, 194, 'list_0_content', 'Hat Then (Then singing), a distinctive musical genre and a special combination of the spiritual and cultural life of Tay, Nung and Thai ethnic groups in Vietnam, has drawn the attention of many collectors and researchers over the past decade. As a unique combination of music and song, Then singing is traditionally accompanied by a handmade gourd lute, called Dan Tinh or Tinh Tau. The form of art plays an important role in the spiritual life of Tay, Nung and Thai ethnic people as it combines a wide range of arts such as literature, music, painting and performance. The art form has had an impact on local and national identities through its influence on literature, language, poetry, music, dance, rituals and spiritual practices. Closely linked with the spiritual life of ethnic minority groups who often use ceremonial offerings to treat illnesses, Then singing is seen as a therapy, together with medicine, helping to ease the worries of patients and their families.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPresently, Tay people often organize singing ceremonies with the aim to drive away bad luck, pray for good crops and call back the souls of the dead. The music encourages ethnic people who gather around the fire every night after a hard working day in the fields to sing together traditional Then songs. It is really a beautiful image to see Tay girls and boys in traditional clothes singing with high and clear voices amid the imposing scene of mountains and forests. At a time when Then singing artists are getting older and not many young people show their love for the tradition, it is necessary to diversify methods to preserve the singing. Apart from collection and restoration of traditional Then songs, relevant agencies should pay special attention to Then singing artists, who can impart both Then singing skills and their passion for the art to younger generations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI would suggest the establishment of Then singing clubs and including the art form to the school curriculum. It should be further promoted on mass media, helping young people understand about the nation’s art heritage and raise their responsibility for preserving and developing it.

(1885, 231, 'list_1_content', 'Embarking on an internship journey at Got It, Inc. as an AI intern was not just a stepping stone in my career; it was a profound learning experience that left a lasting impact on my professional growth. Over the course of my internship, I had the privilege of delving into the world of Artificial Intelligence, where I honed my skills, deepened my knowledge, and played a pivotal role in the organization\'s ongoing success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Enhancing Python Programming Skills</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the central pillars of my internship was the significant improvement in my Python programming skills. As a fundamental language for AI development, Python is the linchpin of numerous AI projects. During my tenure at Got It, Inc., I had the opportunity to write code that was both functional and efficient.

Effective organization streamlined the development process, making it more efficient and enabling our team to work seamlessly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Mastering Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code</strong>\r\n\r\nThe world of AI is intrinsically tied to powerful tools, and my internship introduced me to two invaluable ones - Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. Jupyter Notebook became my trusted companion for interactive data analysis and reporting. Its versatility allowed me to explore data and present findings in an engaging and informative manner. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, became my go-to platform for code development, debugging, and version control. These tools not only facilitated my work but also accelerated my learning curve, allowing me to be more productive and collaborative.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Testing and Suggesting Improvements</strong>\r\n\r\nAs an AI intern, I had the responsibility of rigorously testing applications and AI products. This task was a crucial step in ensuring the quality and performance of the projects we were working on. I was not just identifying issues and bugs but also actively contributing by suggesting improvements. This hands-on experience enabled me to understand the importance of quality assurance in AI and the iterative nature of development.\r\n\r\nMy internship at Got It, Inc. was a transformative journey that allowed me to evolve as an AI professional. It was a unique blend of learning and contribution, where I not only improved my Python programming skills, honed my problem-solving abilities, and mastered essential AI tools but also actively participated in the development and enhancement of AI applications. This experience has left an indelible mark on my career and has ignited a continued passion for the limitless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained during this internship in my future endeavors.'),

Having previously worked for IBM Watson, he decided to join Got It approximately three years ago and frequently commutes between the United States and Vietnam to work with Got It\'s team in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn a recent visit, he was pleasantly surprised to find a young boy walking around the Got It Vietnam office. He was curious and had many questions!\r\n\r\nThe young boy was Tuấn Anh, who is only 13 years old. Last year, he became the youngest software engineering intern at Got It. On his first day, he had just graduated from the 6th grade. In a little over three months, Tuấn Anh completed an impressive university-level course and even worked on a self-driving car project.\r\n\r\n\"My mom knew I was interested in programming and started looking for anything related to it that I could do online. She stumbled upon Got It. My mom asked her friends how Got It worked and managed to arrange an interview for me, which led to my internship here,\" Tuấn Anh shared with Gabi Zuniga. Before joining Got It, Tuấn Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. He emphasized that his goal was to build a solid foundation for the future rather than winning competitions or impressing his mother.\r\n\r\n\"This kid is truly amazing!\" Gabi Zuniga exclaimed in surprise as he listened to Tuấn Anh\'s story of learning and creating a software-based self-driving car with guidance from Got It\'s engineers.'),

This course harnesses the power of Scratch, a platform developed by the esteemed MIT Media Lab at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Scratch also serves as an online community where children worldwide can collaborate and share the stories, games, and animations they create using this innovative tool. Furthermore, I integrated comprehensive theories and lectures from the book \"Scratch Programming Playground\" to reinforce students\' knowledge and foster their growth throughout the learning journey.\r\n\r\nMy primary objective in this endeavor was to ignite a passion for technology within the hearts of young learners. I aimed to equip them with essential skills such as problem-solving, critical analysis, and optimization, which are fundamental aspects of what we call \"Computational Thinking.\" I strived to instill enthusiasm in these children, showing them how to brainstorm ideas, construct, and operate their own games.\r\n\r\nMy tenure at Steam for Vietnam was filled with cherished moments shared with these young minds. Each child possesses unique dreams and aspirations, and my hope is that, regardless of their chosen paths, they will carry with them a deep-seated love for the endless possibilities that technology and learning can offer.'),

As a unique combination of music and song, Then singing is traditionally accompanied by a handmade gourd lute, called Dan Tinh or Tinh Tau. The form of art plays an important role in the spiritual life of Tay, Nung and Thai ethnic people as it combines a wide range of arts such as literature, music, painting and performance. The art form has had an impact on local and national identities through its influence on literature, language, poetry, music, dance, rituals and spiritual practices. Closely linked with the spiritual life of ethnic minority groups who often use ceremonial offerings to treat illnesses, Then singing is seen as a therapy, together with medicine, helping to ease the worries of patients and their families.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPresently, Tay people often organize singing ceremonies with the aim to drive away bad luck, pray for good crops and call back the souls of the dead. The music encourages ethnic people who gather around the fire every night after a hard working day in the fields to sing together traditional Then songs. It is really a beautiful image to see Tay girls and boys in traditional clothes singing with high and clear voices amid the imposing scene of mountains and forests. At a time when Then singing artists are getting older and not many young people show their love for the tradition, it is necessary to diversify methods to preserve the singing.

The experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, furthering my understanding of the language\'s intricacies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>The Art of Problem-Solving and Organization</strong>\r\n\r\nAI development is often akin to solving intricate puzzles, and my internship honed my problem-solving abilities. The projects I worked on presented multifaceted challenges that required creative and analytical thinking. These experiences not only tested my skills but also broadened my problem-solving repertoire. I learned to analyze data, develop algorithms, and troubleshoot issues as they arose, a skill set that extends far beyond AI into everyday problem-solving.\r\n\r\nAnother vital aspect of my internship was organization. In the fast-paced world of AI development, maintaining order and structure is essential. I was responsible for managing data, code, and project-related documents. Effective organization streamlined the development process, making it more efficient and enabling our team to work seamlessly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Mastering Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code</strong>\r\n\r\nThe world of AI is intrinsically tied to powerful tools, and my internship introduced me to two invaluable ones - Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. Jupyter Notebook became my trusted companion for interactive data analysis and reporting. Its versatility allowed me to explore data and present findings in an engaging and informative manner. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, became my go-to platform for code development, debugging, and version control. These tools not only facilitated my work but also accelerated my learning curve, allowing me to be more productive and collaborative.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Testing and Suggesting Improvements</strong>\r\n\r\nAs an AI intern, I had the responsibility of rigorously testing applications and AI products. This task was a crucial step in ensuring the quality and performance of the projects we were working on. I was not just identifying issues and bugs but also actively contributing by suggesting improvements. This hands-on experience enabled me to understand the importance of quality assurance in AI and the iterative nature of development.\r\n\r\nMy internship at Got It, Inc. was a transformative journey that allowed me to evolve as an AI professional. It was a unique blend of learning and contribution, where I not only improved my Python programming skills, honed my problem-solving abilities, and mastered essential AI tools but also actively participated in the development and enhancement of AI applications. This experience has left an indelible mark on my career and has ignited a continued passion for the limitless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained during this internship in my future endeavors.'),

Over the course of my internship, I had the privilege of delving into the world of Artificial Intelligence, where I honed my skills, deepened my knowledge, and played a pivotal role in the organization\'s ongoing success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Enhancing Python Programming Skills</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the central pillars of my internship was the significant improvement in my Python programming skills. As a fundamental language for AI development, Python is the linchpin of numerous AI projects. During my tenure at Got It, Inc., I had the opportunity to write code that was both functional and efficient. This journey involved mastering Python libraries, frameworks, and, most importantly, the best practices for Python development. The experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, furthering my understanding of the language\'s intricacies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>The Art of Problem-Solving and Organization</strong>\r\n\r\nAI development is often akin to solving intricate puzzles, and my internship honed my problem-solving abilities. The projects I worked on presented multifaceted challenges that required creative and analytical thinking. These experiences not only tested my skills but also broadened my problem-solving repertoire. I learned to analyze data, develop algorithms, and troubleshoot issues as they arose, a skill set that extends far beyond AI into everyday problem-solving.\r\n\r\nAnother vital aspect of my internship was organization. In the fast-paced world of AI development, maintaining order and structure is essential. I was responsible for managing data, code, and project-related documents. Effective organization streamlined the development process, making it more efficient and enabling our team to work seamlessly.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Mastering Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code</strong>\r\n\r\nThe world of AI is intrinsically tied to powerful tools, and my internship introduced me to two invaluable ones - Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. Jupyter Notebook became my trusted companion for interactive data analysis and reporting. Its versatility allowed me to explore data and present findings in an engaging and informative manner. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, became my go-to platform for code development, debugging, and version control. These tools not only facilitated my work but also accelerated my learning curve, allowing me to be more productive and collaborative.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Testing and Suggesting Improvements</strong>\r\n\r\nAs an AI intern, I had the responsibility of rigorously testing applications and AI products. This task was a crucial step in ensuring the quality and performance of the projects we were working on. I was not just identifying issues and bugs but also actively contributing by suggesting improvements. This hands-on experience enabled me to understand the importance of quality assurance in AI and the iterative nature of development.\r\n\r\nMy internship at Got It, Inc. was a transformative journey that allowed me to evolve as an AI professional. It was a unique blend of learning and contribution, where I not only improved my Python programming skills, honed my problem-solving abilities, and mastered essential AI tools but also actively participated in the development and enhancement of AI applications. This experience has left an indelible mark on my career and has ignited a continued passion for the limitless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained during this internship in my future endeavors.'),

He was curious and had many questions!\r\n\r\nThe young boy was Tuấn Anh, who is only 13 years old. Last year, he became the youngest software engineering intern at Got It.

Before joining Got It, Tuấn Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/5u1SZCWxq-o?si=0LneRENU1P8rZhYE\r\n\r\nIn addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. He emphasized that his goal was to build a solid foundation for the future rather than winning competitions or impressing his mother.\r\n\r\n\"This kid is truly amazing!\" Gabi Zuniga exclaimed in surprise as he listened to Tuấn Anh\'s story of learning and creating a software-based self-driving car with guidance from Got It\'s engineers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-162 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ex-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"954\" height=\"480\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>2.<b>Mr. Hung Tran - My AI Teacher and Hero at Got It</b></strong>\r\n\r\nDr. Trần Việt Hùng, 41 years old, is the founder of Got It, a technology startup that has raised $25 million in investment and is headquartered in Silicon Valley, USA. One summer day in 2019, he received a letter requesting an internship at Got It from a 13-year-old boy. Despite having only a bit of programming knowledge, the young boy desired to gain real-world experience as a programmer during his summer break. Seeing a reflection of his younger self in the boy, Dr. Hùng decided to accept him as an intern and provide additional training.

He and the engineers at Got It then guided the young boy in collecting data to train AI models and enable AI to control the car. Eventually, the car could drive itself, leaving many people astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Kids these days are quite remarkable.

Before joining Got It, Tuấn Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/5u1SZCWxq-o?si=0LneRENU1P8rZhYE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds.

This task was a crucial step in ensuring the quality and performance of the projects we were working on. I was not just identifying issues and bugs but also actively contributing by suggesting improvements. This hands-on experience enabled me to understand the importance of quality assurance in AI and the iterative nature of development.\r\n\r\nMy internship at Got It, Inc. was a transformative journey that allowed me to evolve as an AI professional. It was a unique blend of learning and contribution, where I not only improved my Python programming skills, honed my problem-solving abilities, and mastered essential AI tools but also actively participated in the development and enhancement of AI applications. This experience has left an indelible mark on my career and has ignited a continued passion for the limitless possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained during this internship in my future endeavors.'),

Having previously worked for IBM Watson, he decided to join Got It approximately three years ago and frequently commutes between the United States and Vietnam to work with Got It\'s team in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn a recent visit, he was pleasantly surprised to find a young boy walking around the Got It Vietnam office. He was curious and had many questions!\r\n\r\nThe young boy was Tuấn Anh, who is only 13 years old. Last year, he became the youngest software engineering intern at Got It. On his first day, he had just graduated from the 6th grade. In a little over three months, Tuấn Anh completed an impressive university-level course and even worked on a self-driving car project.\r\n\r\n\"My mom knew I was interested in programming and started looking for anything related to it that I could do online. She stumbled upon Got It. My mom asked her friends how Got It worked and managed to arrange an interview for me, which led to my internship here,\" Tuấn Anh shared with Gabi Zuniga. Before joining Got It, Tuấn Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. He emphasized that his goal was to build a solid foundation for the future rather than winning competitions or impressing his mother.\r\n\r\n\"This kid is truly amazing!\" Gabi Zuniga exclaimed in surprise as he listened to Tuấn Anh\'s story of learning and creating a software-based self-driving car with guidance from Got It\'s engineers.'),

During the scorching summer days in Hanoi, where temperatures peak at 40°C, devastating fires cause both human and property losses, leaving a profound impact on the community. This drove me to develop a fixed camera system capable of monitoring large areas and promptly alerting the system to extinguish fires upon detection.\r\n\r\nMy approach involved utilizing knowledge in image processing, deep learning, Arduino programming, and Python programming to design an integrated system. This system incorporated a centralized computer network that spanned various locations, transmitting data to a central control machine. It effectively monitored and detected illegal deforestation, issuing timely warnings to forest agencies. Additionally, I developed an application specifically designed to monitor and detect forest fires in remote mountainous regions, contributing to enhanced fire prevention and safety measures.'),

Heartbreaking incidents resulted from individuals operating vehicles with high levels of alcohol in their system, exceeding legal limits. My journey began in 7th grade, embarking on my first AI programming project, which was applied to the self-driving car project designed by GotIt\'s Founder and Chief Architect, Gabi Zuniga. During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to learn from the experts at Got It Inc. The future expanded before me as I designed an AI-based delivery robot that autonomously followed pre-programmed routes. The concept of driverless cars was relatively new in Vietnam, and the revelation that a robot could operate independently using AI technology surprised many. My story of creating a self-driving car as an 7th-grade student opened doors to meeting numerous experts in Vietnam\'s technology industry. I hope it serves as motivation for young tech enthusiasts, demonstrating that it\'s never too early or too late to pursue their dreams.'),

As a unique combination of music and song, Then singing is traditionally accompanied by a handmade gourd lute, called Dan Tinh or Tinh Tau. The form of art plays an important role in the spiritual life of Tay, Nung and Thai ethnic people as it combines a wide range of arts such as literature, music, painting and performance.\r\n\r\nThe art form has had an impact on local and national identities through its influence on literature, language, poetry, music, dance, rituals and spiritual practices. Closely linked with the spiritual life of ethnic minority groups who often use ceremonial offerings to treat illnesses, Then singing is seen as a therapy, together with medicine, helping to ease the worries of patients and their families.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-278 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frame-1056-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1539\" height=\"730\" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPresently, Tay people often organize singing ceremonies with the aim to drive away bad luck, pray for good crops and call back the souls of the dead. The music encourages ethnic people who gather around the fire every night after a hard working day in the fields to sing together traditional Then songs. It is really a beautiful image to see Tay girls and boys in traditional clothes singing with high and clear voices amid the imposing scene of mountains and forests. At a time when Then singing artists are getting older and not many young people show their love for the tradition, it is necessary to diversify methods to preserve the singing. Apart from collection and restoration of traditional Then songs, relevant agencies should pay special attention to Then singing artists, who can impart both Then singing skills and their passion for the art to younger generations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI would suggest the establishment of Then singing clubs and including the art form to the school curriculum. It should be further promoted on mass media, helping young people understand about the nation’s art heritage and raise their responsibility for preserving and developing it.

More than just a musical instrument that aids in stress relief and relaxation, the piano serves as a source of inspiration, leaving me feeling refreshed and optimistic.\r\n\r\nMusic, in its essence, often acts as a panacea, bestowing inner peace and calm upon one\'s spirit. For me, it\'s an exquisite elixir that soothes moments of tension and brings solace to my soul. My connection with the piano is deeply ingrained, and I find myself turning to it during moments of leisure, in times of melancholy, and even when my spirits are high. The presence of music never fails to illuminate and enrich the day, making it more vibrant and beautiful.\r\n\r\nWith a profound appreciation for music, I embarked on my piano journey from a tender age, and by the time I reached the 7th grade, I had proudly achieved the remarkable feat of completing the Grade 6/8 program offered by Trinity College. This musical journey continues to be a significant part of my life, offering a continual source of joy and inspiration.'),

As a unique combination of music and song, Then singing is traditionally accompanied by a handmade gourd lute, called Dan Tinh or Tinh Tau. The form of art plays an important role in the spiritual life of Tay, Nung and Thai ethnic people as it combines a wide range of arts such as literature, music, painting and performance.\r\n\r\nThe art form has had an impact on local and national identities through its influence on literature, language, poetry, music, dance, rituals and spiritual practices. Closely linked with the spiritual life of ethnic minority groups who often use ceremonial offerings to treat illnesses, Then singing is seen as a therapy, together with medicine, helping to ease the worries of patients and their families\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-289 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frame-1056-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1539\" height=\"730\" />\r\n\r\nPresently, Tay people often organize singing ceremonies with the aim to drive away bad luck, pray for good crops and call back the souls of the dead. The music encourages ethnic people who gather around the fire every night after a hard working day in the fields to sing together traditional Then songs. It is really a beautiful image to see Tay girls and boys in traditional clothes singing with high and clear voices amid the imposing scene of mountains and forests. At a time when Then singing artists are getting older and not many young people show their love for the tradition, it is necessary to diversify methods to preserve the singing. Apart from collection and restoration of traditional Then songs, relevant agencies should pay special attention to Then singing artists, who can impart both Then singing skills and their passion for the art to younger generations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI would suggest the establishment of Then singing clubs and including the art form to the school curriculum. It should be further promoted on mass media, helping young people understand about the nation’s art heritage and raise their responsibility for preserving and developing it.

Having previously worked for IBM Watson, he decided to join Got It approximately three years ago and frequently commutes between the United States and Vietnam to work with Got It\'s team in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn a recent visit, he was pleasantly surprised to find a young boy walking around the Got It Vietnam office. He was curious and had many questions!\r\n\r\nThe young boy was Tuấn Anh, who is only 13 years old. Last year, he became the youngest software engineering intern at Got It. On his first day, he had just graduated from the 6th grade. In a little over three months, Tuấn Anh completed an impressive university-level course and even worked on a self-driving car project.\r\n\r\n\"My mom knew I was interested in programming and started looking for anything related to it that I could do online. She stumbled upon Got It. My mom asked her friends how Got It worked and managed to arrange an interview for me, which led to my internship here,\" Tuấn Anh shared with Gabi Zuniga. Before joining Got It, Tuấn Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. He emphasized that his goal was to build a solid foundation for the future rather than winning competitions or impressing his mother.\r\n\r\n\"This kid is truly amazing!\" Gabi Zuniga exclaimed in surprise as he listened to Tuấn Anh\'s story of learning and creating a software-based self-driving car with guidance from Got It\'s engineers.'),

During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to learn from the experts at Got It Inc. The future expanded before me as I designed an AI-based delivery robot that autonomously followed pre-programmed routes. The concept of driverless cars was relatively new in Vietnam, and the revelation that a robot could operate independently using AI technology surprised many. My story of creating a self-driving car as an 7th-grade student opened doors to meeting numerous experts in Vietnam\'s technology industry. I hope it serves as motivation for young tech enthusiasts, demonstrating that it\'s never too early or too late to pursue their dreams.</p>'),

During the scorching summer days in Hanoi, where temperatures peak at 40°C, devastating fires cause both human and property losses, leaving a profound impact on the community.

This system incorporated a centralized computer network that spanned various locations, transmitting data to a central control machine.

Additionally, I developed an application specifically designed to monitor and detect forest fires in remote mountainous regions, contributing to enhanced fire prevention and safety measures.</p>'),

Heartbreaking incidents resulted from individuals operating vehicles with high levels of alcohol in their system, exceeding legal limits. My journey began in 7th grade, embarking on my first AI programming project, which was applied to the self-driving car project designed by GotIt\'s Founder and Chief Architect, Gabi Zuniga. During this time, I had the invaluable opportunity to learn from the experts at Got It Inc. The future expanded before me as I designed an AI-based delivery robot that autonomously followed pre-programmed routes. The concept of driverless cars was relatively new in Vietnam, and the revelation that a robot could operate independently using AI technology surprised many. My story of creating a self-driving car as an 7th-grade student opened doors to meeting numerous experts in Vietnam\'s technology industry. I hope it serves as motivation for young tech enthusiasts, demonstrating that it\'s never early or late to pursue their dreams.</p>'),

What\'s even more exciting is that we went on to host a SECOND charity show, which was an absolute blast in every sense of the word. Upbeat will forever hold a special place in my heart, rent-free. It marks my first live performance, in front of a diverse audience, alongside my friends.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind every live performance on the stage, the Upbeat band, comprising seven talented and charismatic individuals, will be the ambassadors of vibrant melodies and colorful sounds, promising spontaneity and musical brilliance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with all of Upbeat\'s projects, \"The Light Show\" is a fundraising endeavor through ticket sales. Upbeat commits to allocating all proceeds from the concert to contribute to the welfare of underprivileged children.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Upbeat\'s journey is one of music, camaraderie, and the joy of giving back, and it is an experience that I will cherish deeply.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-222 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1304-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36pt;\"><strong>2.Performance of Dan Tinh &amp; Then Singing at the Vietnamese National Academy Of Music.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the lyrical verses of the Tày people\'s \"Mùa hoa lê\" Then song, which I would loosely translate as \"In our village, the pear blossoms bloom, sparkling waters, the stream sings with delight,\" the joyful lyrics resonate with the gentle melodies of the Tính tẩu (Tày folk music) amidst the backdrop of Hanoi\'s landscapes. <i>Then </i>singing has the power to dispel the chill of winter and transport listeners across the high mountains to the majestic landscapes of the Northwest.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The enchanting charm of Then singing lies in its simplicity, sincerity, accessibility, and emotive qualities. Listening to Then is an instant source of joy and delight. Moreover, the pure and poetic lyrics of Then depict the beauty of nature, love, and the homeland, often leaving one utterly captivated.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">UpBeat regularly participates in musical exchanges, collaborating with students, enthusiasts, and the Tày ethnic community at the National Academy of Music in Vietnam. Through our involvement, we hope to not only preserve and promote the Then tradition for those who cherish it but also actively engage with and perform at events organized by the Tày community in the capital.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With these initiatives, UpBeat aspires to connect and share the beauty of Then music, transcending boundaries and preserving the rich cultural heritage of the Tày people, and extending it to a broader audience, bringing the world closer to the enchanting rhythms of Tày folk music.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-224 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frame-1123123u.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1539\" height=\"730\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36pt;\"><strong>3.A tour and performance of Dan Tinh\r\nThen singing at Homestay Trieu Cuong</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I organized a cultural immersion trip for UpBeat Club members to provide them with a deep understanding of the Tày ethnic culture. The lush green surroundings, simple and peaceful way of life, and unique cultural aspects of the Tày people left a profound impression on everyone who visited this place.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Traveling along winding, picturesque roads and observing stilt houses nestled on the hillside, beneath the shade of cool trees, one could sense the serene life of the local inhabitants. Thượng Lâm Commune is not only renowned for its vast terraced fields but also as one of the cradles of the traditional Then singing style of the Tày ethnic group. Here, almost everyone can sing a few lines of Then songs, with many children as young as 6 or 7 years old participating in local Then singing clubs and Tính music ensembles within their village and commune.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These young enthusiasts eagerly learn and strive to sing beautifully and authentically because it\'s a source of pride for their ethnic community. In the autumn, the atmosphere in the Thái Hải village is refreshing and mild. Sitting in a local wine house, listening to the Then song \"Tuyen Quang yêu thương,\" sung from the heart and filled with the emotions of the locals, with a cup of fragrant, sticky rice wine in hand, one can feel the rustic yet profound sentiments of the people living in this region.</p>', 'President · UPBEAT (Oct 2021 - Sep 2023)', 'Upbeat has been and will always be a source of immense pride for me.

The event provided a day full of information, knowledge sharing, and learning opportunities from reputable speakers in the field.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaker Tran Minh Quang kicked off the event with an engaging presentation on the importance of STEM in modern and future life. He emphasized the decisive role of STEM in addressing global challenges and exploring new potentials.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workshop concluded with an interactive session with the audience, allowing them to ask questions and exchange opinions with the speakers. The event helped create an open environment for sharing knowledge and connecting individuals interested in STEM.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a world filled with challenges and opportunities, the Online STEM Topic Workshop, featuring top speakers, has contributed to the advancement of this field, and it is hoped that it will continue to pave the way for new developments in the future.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-213 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frame-1057.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1539\" height=\"753\" />\n\n<strong>2.<b>STEMPIRE Science Day 2023- Science Exhibition</b></strong>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The STEMpire Club was established with a mission to popularize STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and engineering sciences among passionate and curious students. We also aspire to make meaningful contributions to our community and connect with like-minded students. Simply put, we aim to create an environment where students can satisfy their scientific passions.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In pursuit of this goal, our club members collaborated to develop a program that included an exhibition showcasing scientific and engineering products and a collaborative effort to build a library with Phan Thiết Middle School.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through these activities, STEMpire Club aimed to provide an incredible experience for the participating students. They had the opportunity to use and experience scientific and technological products like automated robots, electronic circuits, and artificial intelligence systems, all guided by STEMpire Club members. Notably, after experiencing these scientific products, STEMpire Club gifted Phan Thiết Middle School a model of a smart solar-powered house, constructed, designed, and programmed by our very own club members.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, STEMpire Club was pleased to provide the school with English books and a desktop computer, all in an effort to support the school in building its library. We hope that this support will aid the school and its students in more effectively engaging with STEM subjects and sparking a passion for learning, research, and exploration in the field of science and engineering.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>3.<span class=\"Y2IQFc\" lang=\"en\">Visit Tuyen Quang Hydroelectric Plant</span></strong>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The visit to the Tuyen Quang hydropower plant was truly an incredible and memorable experience for me.

One summer day in 2019, he received a letter requesting an internship at Got It from a 13-year-old boy. Despite having only a bit of programming knowledge, the young boy desired to gain real-world experience as a programmer during his summer break. Seeing a reflection of his younger self in the boy, Dr. Hung decided to accept him as an intern and provide additional training.

Eventually, the car could drive itself, leaving many people astonished.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Kids these days are quite remarkable.

Thượng Lâm Commune is not only renowned for its vast terraced fields but also as one of the cradles of the traditional Then singing style of the Tày ethnic group. Here, almost everyone can sing a few lines of Then songs, with many children as young as 6 or 7 years old participating in local Then singing clubs and Tính music ensembles within their village and commune.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">These young enthusiasts eagerly learn and strive to sing beautifully and authentically because it\'s a source of pride for their ethnic community. In the autumn, the atmosphere in the Thái Hải village is refreshing and mild.

It was such an enjoyable and memorable time. I\'m thrilled that we managed to have so much fun during a charity show. What\'s even more exciting is that we went on to host a SECOND charity show, which was an absolute blast in every sense of the word. Upbeat will forever hold a special place in my heart, rent-free.

One summer day in 2019, he received a letter requesting an internship at Got It from a 13-year-old boy. Despite having only a bit of programming knowledge, the young boy desired to gain real-world experience as a programmer during his summer break. Seeing a reflection of his younger self in the boy, Dr. Hung decided to accept him as an intern and provide additional training. Having previously taught university students, Dr. Hùng experimented by using American university-level materials to educate the young boy.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-162 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ex-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"954\" height=\"480\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the boy\'s \"graduation project,\" which involved creating a self-driving car with artificial intelligence, Dr. Hung purchased a remote-controlled car, removed all of its components, replaced them with a Raspberry Pi circuit board, and connected it to a small camera. He and the engineers at Got It then guided the young boy in collecting data to train AI models and enable AI to control the car. Eventually, the car could drive itself, leaving many people astonished.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Kids these days are quite remarkable. If they are given early access to technology, they will develop and have a very bright future,\" Dr. Hung thought, and he aspired to do something for the youth of Vietnam.</p>', 'Youngest Talented Intern in Vietnam at Global Technology Company, Got It AI.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '291-revision-v1', '', '', '2023-11-01 13:46:14', '2023-11-01 13:46:14', '', 291, 'http://localhost/trasua/?p=430', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

She stumbled upon Got It. My mom asked her friends how Got It worked and managed to arrange an interview for me, which led to my internship here,\" Tuan Anh shared with Gabi Zuniga. Before joining Got It, Tuan Anh had some knowledge of web design, including HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. However, at Got It, he learned much more about programming languages, especially Python, and completed a course using American university-level materials. He also delved into artificial intelligence and applied it to a challenging project, creating a mini self-driving car in a learn-as-you-go style.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to his technical skills, Tuấn Anh focused on improving his English and soft skills to work and communicate effectively with colleagues from diverse cultural backgrounds. He emphasized that his goal was to build a solid foundation for the future rather than winning competitions or impressing his mother.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This kid is truly amazing!\" Gabi Zuniga exclaimed in surprise as he listened to Tuan Anh\'s story of learning and creating a software-based self-driving car with guidance from Got It\'s engineers.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36pt;\"><b>2.Mr. Hung Tran - My AI Teacher and Hero at Got It</b></span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el90HTd549I\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Tran Viet Hung, 41 years old, is the founder of Got It, a technology startup that has raised $25 million in investment and is headquartered in Silicon Valley, USA. One summer day in 2019, he received a letter requesting an internship at Got It from a 13-year-old boy. Despite having only a bit of programming knowledge, the young boy desired to gain real-world experience as a programmer during his summer break. Seeing a reflection of his younger self in the boy, Dr. Hung decided to accept him as an intern and provide additional training. Having previously taught university students, Dr. Hung experimented by using American university-level materials to educate the young boy.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-162 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/trasua/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ex-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"954\" height=\"480\" />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the boy\'s \"graduation project,\" which involved creating a self-driving car with artificial intelligence, Dr. Hung purchased a remote-controlled car, removed all of its components, replaced them with a Raspberry Pi circuit board, and connected it to a small camera. He and the engineers at Got It then guided the young boy in collecting data to train AI models and enable AI to control the car. Eventually, the car could drive itself, leaving many people astonished.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Kids these days are quite remarkable.

Thượng Lâm Commune is not only renowned for its vast terraced fields but also as one of the cradles of the traditional Then singing style of the Tày ethnic group. Here, almost everyone can sing a few lines of Then songs, with many children as young as 6 or 7 years old participating in local Then singing clubs and Tính music ensembles within their village and commune.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These young enthusiasts eagerly learn and strive to sing beautifully and authentically because it\'s a source of pride for their ethnic community. In the autumn, the atmosphere in the Thái Hải village is refreshing and mild.
